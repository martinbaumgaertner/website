abstract: "This paper studies the effect of uncertainty on monetary policy shocks for the euro area. The analysis shows that various forms of forward guidance under high uncertainty produce results similar to those attributed to information shocks in the literature. This effect can be seen in high-frequency variables and VAR models with external instruments. The results suggest that uncertainty is related to information shocks and can potentially explain the timing of these shocks."

## Abstract

This paper studies the effect of uncertainty on monetary policy shocks for the euro area. The analysis shows that various forms of forward guidance under high uncertainty produce results similar to those attributed to information shocks in the literature. This effect can be seen in high-frequency variables and VAR models with external instruments. The results suggest that uncertainty is related to information shocks and can potentially explain the timing of these shocks.
