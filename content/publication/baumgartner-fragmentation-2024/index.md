abstract: "In 2022, the ECB introduced a new instrument designed to combat fragmentation in euro area government bond yields. To assess the ECB's effectiveness in addressing fragmentation through existing instruments, particularly communication, we turn to a pivotal historical event – Mario Draghi's famous 'whatever it takes' speech. Widely interpreted as a commitment by the ECB to act as a lender of last resort, this speech eased tensions in bond markets. Employing state-of-the-art computational linguistics, we create an index that quantifies the ECB's commitment to act as a lender of last resort based on this historic speech. Our index highlights the ECB's central role in stabilizing financial markets, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty."

## Abstract

In 2022, the ECB introduced a new instrument designed to combat fragmentation in euro area government bond yields. To assess the ECB's effectiveness in addressing fragmentation through existing instruments, particularly communication, we turn to a pivotal historical event – Mario Draghi's famous "whatever it takes" speech. Widely interpreted as a commitment by the ECB to act as a lender of last resort, this speech eased tensions in bond markets. Employing state-of-the-art computational linguistics, we create an index that quantifies the ECB's commitment to act as a lender of last resort based on this historic speech. Our index highlights the ECB's central role in stabilizing financial markets, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty.
